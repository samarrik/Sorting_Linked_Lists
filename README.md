## Disclamer
This repository contains the code of the task, I've made that small project for the subject [Programming and Algorithms 1](https://courses.fit.cvut.cz/BI-PA1/) studied during the second semester at the Czech Technical University in Prague.

## Description
The task was to implement a set of functions (not the whole program, just functions) for working with linked lists. The function will allow the list to be easily created, deleted and sorted.
